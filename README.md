I have compiled all the datacamp projects I have been solving until this day. These projects are listed below:

 1) **_predictive_modeling_agriculture_**

Supervised machine learning and feature selection with logistic regression to select the best soil cultivation indicator that predicts the highest crop growth. The best soil indicator is <ins>**potassium (K)**</ins> for all types of crops.
 
 2) **_taxi_fare_random_forest_**

Analyzed 2013 NYC taxi journey data to predict fares and tips using regression trees and random forests. The taxi fare prediction is based on the location on Manhattan's island and the time of day. The most expensive location from the model is <ins>**downtown**</ins>.

 3) **_kmeans_clustering_penguin_species_**

Application of K-means clustering to label penguin species based on their physical characteristics. This analysis showed that the best solution is <ins>**3 clusters**</ins>.
